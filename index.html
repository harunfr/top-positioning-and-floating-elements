              A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than
              researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been
              <a>exploring Gale crater</a> for more than eight years, and while
              early observations suggested the entire crater may once have been
              filled with water, a new analysis implies that it just had a
              series of ponds instead.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">
              Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a
              measure called the chemical index of alteration to determine how
              rocks were weathered over time. <a>Joseph Michalski</a> at the
              University of Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that
              because this measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be
              valid in the extreme Martian climate.
            </p>
            <p class="third-paragraph">
              Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds
              that are expected to change based on different types of weathering
              over time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity
              examined did interact with water at some point in their past, but
              more are likely to have formed outside of the water.

            </p>
            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
              “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers
              that are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower
              few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover…
              the fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1
              per cent.”
            </p>
            <p class="fifth-paragraph">
              These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of
              <a>sediments in the crater</a>, suggesting the lake was not nearly
              as deep or extensive as we thought. “There was likely a small lake
              or more likely a series of small lakes in the floor of Gale
              crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.
            </p>
            <p class="sixth-paragraph">
              The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so
              Michalski says that they may have formed out of ash from volcanic
              eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up.
              Observations by other Mars missions have hinted that these
              sediments were deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve
              that mismatch.
